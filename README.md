Hi, this build started off as a practical solution to a challenge I found at work, the app was supposed to be about creatures living in a bog. Once the creatures were shown, I decided to take it a notch higher and build an api that shows the location of the user by taking advantage of the inbuilt geolocation methods in your browser.

## Technologies used
  * Express
  * Node.js
  * React

## Use
As a learning tool, I did not see the need to host this application on a web server. Users will need to be download to their computer, just fork and clone this repo and run **npm i** from the main folder, then run **node db/seeds**. Next **cd into the client folder** and run **npm i** and finally **cd..** and type **npm run dev** then enter. Thankyou and leave a comment.
